Practitioner Guides are designed to be used by practitioners who may not be experts in data analysis or open source. The goal is to help you understand how to interpret the data about an open source project to develop insights that can help you improve the project health of an open source project. 

These guides will be especially useful for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), project leads, community managers, maintainers, and anyone who wants to better understand project health and take action on what they learn from their metrics.
