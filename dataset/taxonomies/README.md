# Open Source Taxonomies 

This repository is an experiment designed to collect existing taxonomies about open source projects as well as taxonomies used/created within research about open source ecosystems.

As all submissions will be treated as public data - we will not accept submissions with sensitive datatypes (user data, personally identifiable data, non-public business data, health data, etc).
