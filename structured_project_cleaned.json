In business, we increasingly see blogs and wikis demonstrating utility in problem solving and communications but the real time nature of business process problem solving largely remains untouched by social networking tools. Existing services, while attractive do not scale well and have proven unreliable. This is unacceptable to business which must be 'Always On' and able to support people in their daily working lives. Such applications must therefore be scalable and reliable but also provide a lot more.\nWhen solving problems, how good might it be if a user was able to tap into the collective knowledge of her peers or surrounding groups of people with whom she might naturally network in the workplace setting? How much quicker and with greater precision might she be able to solve daily problems? What if there was a communications mechanism that takes the best of what services like Twitter offers and co-mingled that with readily recognizable business processes? That solution is Apache ESME.",

Protocols are pushed out of business logic and are handled through pluggable bindings. This lowers development cost.\n    Applications can easily adapt to infrastructure changes without recoding since protocols are handled via pluggable bindings and quality of services (transaction, security) are handled declaratively.\n    Existing applications can work with new SCA compositions.

Developers using Cayenne will be able to concentrate on the core business requirements and the data model instead of the SQL details. The application can then be easily moved to any JDBC-capable database. In addition to management of persistent Java objects mapped to relational databases, Cayenne provides a plethora of features including single method call queries and updates (including atomic updates of all modified objects), seamless integration of multiple databases into a single virtual data source, three tier persistence with caching on the remote client, paging of results, record locking, and many more features.",

Lucene.Net has three primary goals:\n\n1. Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule;\n2. Maintaining the high-performance requirements expected of a first class C# search engine library;\n3. Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.\n",

It is trivial to achieve parallel execution of simple, \"embarrassingly parallel\" data analysis tasks. Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences, making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.\n * Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are encoded permits the system to optimize their execution automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than efficiency.\n * Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do special-purpose processing.\n",

        "Project Name": "Apache XMLBeans",
        "Category": "xml",
        "Description": "XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a Java friendly way. The idea\n            is that you can take advantage of the richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features\n            mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML\n            Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data.\n            Using XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class, you will see things like getFoo or setFoo\n            just as you would expect when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML\n            instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also API's that allow you access to the full XML\n            infoset (XMLBeans keeps XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself\n            through an XML Schema Object model.\n\n            For more details on XMLBeans see the XMLBeans Wiki pages or the XMLBeans documentation (the Documentation\n            tab on this website).\n            What Makes XMLBeans Different\n\n            There are at least two major things that make XMLBeans unique from other XML-Java binding options.\n\n            1. Full XML Schema support. XMLBeans fully supports XML Schema and the corresponding java classes provide\n            constructs for all of the major functionality of XML Schema. This is critical since often times you do not\n            have control over the features of XML Schema that you need to work with in Java. Also, XML Schema oriented\n            applications can take full advantage of the power of XML Schema and not have to restrict themselvs to a\n            subset.\n            2. Full XML Infoset fidelity.When unmarshalling an XML instance the full XML infoset is kept and is\n            available to the developer. This is critical because because of the subset of XML that is not easily\n            represented in java. For example, order of the elements or comments might be needed in a particular\n            application.\n\n            A major objective of XMLBeans has been to be applicable in all non-streaming (in memory) XML programming\n            situations. You should be able to compile your XML Schema into a set of java classes and know that 1) you\n            will be able to use XMLBeans for all of the schemas you encounter (even the warped ones) and 2) that you\n            will be able to get to the XML at whatever level is necessary - and not have to resort to multple tools to\n            do this.\n\n            To accomplish this XMLBeans provides three major APIs:\n\n            * XmlObject The java classes that are generated from an XML Schema are all derived from XmlObject. These\n            provide strongly typed getters and setters for each of the elements within the defined XML. Complex types\n            are in turn XmlObjects. For example getCustomer might return a CustomerType (which is an XmlObject). Simple\n            types turn into simple getters and setters with the correct java type. For example getName might return a\n            String.\n            * XmlCursor From any XmlObject you can get an XmlCursor. This provides efficient, low level access to the\n            XML Infoset. A cursor represents a position in the XML instance. You can move the cursor around the XML\n            instance at any level of granularity you need from individual characters to Tokens.\n            * SchemaType XMLBeans provides a full XML Schema object model that you can use to reflect on the underlying\n            schema meta information. For example, you might want to generate a sample XML instance for an XML schema or\n            perhaps find the enumerations for an element so that you can display them.\n\n            All of this was built with performance in mind. Informal benchmarks and user feedback indicate that XMLBeans\n            is extremely fast.\n        ",

The exception is some functions in the C++ API which either have better Perl counterparts (such as file I/O) or which manipulate internal C++ information that has no role in the Perl module.\n    The majority of the API is created automatically using Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG). However, care has been taken to make most method invocations natural to perl programmers, so a number of rough C++ edges have been smoothed over (See the Special Perl API Features section). ",
