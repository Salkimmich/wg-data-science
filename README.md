## Introduction

### Goal

Build a community of data scientists to collaborate on the CHAOSS Data Science Initiative.

### Purpose

We will collaborate with data scientists and researchers to shape how we understand open source community health and make it easier for people to use CHAOSS tools, metrics, and metrics models to draw meaningful insights that they can use to improve open source project health using data science-based approaches.

### Who should join this working group?

Anyone interested in data science and data analysis can join. You don't need to be an expert or know how to perform advanced techniques, like machine learning or artificial intelligence. We welcome data scientists, data analysts, researchers and others with an interest in data.

### Background

This is a working group within the CHAOSS project to support our Data Science Initiative. If you work for a company who is interested in sponsoring some of our work, we have a [sponsorship prospectus](CHAOSS-Data-Science-Prospectus.pdf) with more details.

## Practitioner Guides

The CHAOSS Data Science Working Group drives a set of [Practitioner Guides](https://chaoss.community/about-chaoss-practitioner-guides/) to help people understand how to interpret the data about an open source project to develop insights that can help improve the project health of an open source project. The are designed for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), project leads, community managers, maintainers, and anyone who wants to better understand project health and take action on what they learn from their metrics.

If you are interested in [contributing to the practitioner guides](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/tree/main/practitioner-guides), you can find more details in the practitioner-guides folder here in the repo.

## Projects

We are also working on a number of projects where we use CHAOSS metrics and tools to help answer questions that people have about open source projects and their unique dynamics. You can find details about these projects in the WG's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproject).
